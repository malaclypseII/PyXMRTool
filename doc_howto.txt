The documentation of this project is build automatically by the Sphinx Documentation Generator.

To generate/refresh the documention change to the directory "sphinx_source" and type
"make html" 
or
"make pdf"
or
"make epub"

The result can be found in "sphinx_source/build".

The content of the documentaion is given by ".rst" files in the directory "sphinx_source" which
use the "reStructuredText" markup language (see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

The root file is "index.rst". In the "toctree" section it links to furhter files (stated without the .rst suffix) or folders containing files (like "api").

The ".rst" files within the folder "api" link directly towards the projects source file and generate automatically an api documentation from their docstrings.
Docstrings are stated directly at the beginning of modules, class or function definitions and enclosed in three quotation marks (""") at beginning and end.
